Dutiful tutorial following
Hi, I'm Oliver
I'm 22 years old and I'm about to graduate Brunel University London with a degree in Renewable Energy Engineering

I wonder what future event has persuaded me that I should look back at this old file.

The tutorial said to set this repository as public, so maybe someone else's eyes find it again before mine. 

Who are you then?
